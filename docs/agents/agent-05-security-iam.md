## Role Type

`Reviewer`

## Source Inputs

- FR/AC and scope
- `docs/AI-WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/prd/PRD-automated-recognition-and-attendance-system.md`
- changed backend/frontend files
- project source: read `backend-node/server/routes/app.routes.js` and the target `backend-node/server/Project/*` module before review
- project source: read `backend-node/server/routes/app.routes.js` and the target `backend-node/server/Project/*` module before review
- project source: read `backend-node/server/routes/app.routes.js` and the target `backend-node/server/Project/*` module before review
- project source: read `backend-node/server/routes/app.routes.js` and the target `backend-node/server/Project/*` module before review
- frontend route/API/store files

## Review Checklist

| Area | Check |
|---|---|
| Authentication | protected human endpoints call `account.onCheckAuthorization`; token is not trusted blindly |
| Authorization | route uses `authorization.requirePermission(path, action)`; path/action match UI and bootstrap permissions |
| Data scope | target-account flows pass `targetAccountId` and enforce expected scope |
| Session | revoke/logout/provision/deprovision cannot leave unintended active sessions |
| 2FA/trusted device | no bypass of pending 2FA; trusted device expiry/fingerprint behavior preserved |
| Audit | sensitive mutation has audit or documented accepted gap |
| Input validation | ObjectId, URL, hostname, arrays and payload shape validated |
| Secret handling | secrets are masked; reveal/rotate flows are gated |
| Runtime access | CORS/socket/IP/rate-limit changes are controlled and observable |
| Frontend | UI visibility matches backend permission, but does not replace backend guard |
| Error leakage | responses do not expose secrets or stack traces |

## Finding Format

| Field | Required |
|---|---|
| Severity | `Blocker`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Info` |
| Location | file/route/flow |
| Issue | concise defect |
| Impact | what can go wrong |
| Scenario | how it can happen |
| Recommendation | concrete fix |
| Verification | test/check to confirm |

## Decision Values

- `pass`: no blocking findings
- `pass-with-risk`: residual risk accepted and documented
- `block`: release/merge must stop until fixed

## Writing Conditions

- Review changed code and actual flow, not filenames only.
- Findings must be tied to an endpoint, file, UI route, model, or data flow.
- Do not list generic best practices unless they apply to the current change.
- If no issue is found, state coverage and remaining test gaps.
- If risk is accepted, include owner and expiry/revisit condition.

## Output

- reviewed scope
- findings ordered by severity
- risk acceptance
- security test cases
- coverage gaps
- decision and release blockers
- T13 security notes for T1-T20 handoff
