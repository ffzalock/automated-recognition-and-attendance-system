| Module docs | `docs/modules/*` when present |
| Environment config | static key check only; do not document secret values |

## T2. Progress Calculation

Adjust weights per project, but keep them evidence-backed.

| Readiness Area | Weight | Earned | Basis |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Backend API/services verified | 35 | 0 | Not verified yet. |
| Integration/auth verified | 15 | 0 | Not verified yet. |
| Frontend route/API mapped | 20 | 0 | Not verified yet. |
| Environment/static config checked | 10 | 0 | Not verified yet. |
| Release verification | 15 | 0 | Not verified yet. |
| Tasklist and handoff | 5 | 0 | Not created yet. |
| **Total** | **100** | **0** | Overall status remains pending. |
